The task of ball identification is as such: 
given a precise window inside an image that is assumed to 
contain a ball of the game of pool, we want to identify 
which type it belongs to (whether cueball, 8-ball, striped or 
solid color). We assume we don't need to identify the precise 
number of the ball outside of the number 8 one.

The main insight into this task is the fact that the most 
identifying element of a ball is its amount of white paint. 
A cueball is completely covered in it, a striped ball is 
covered about halfway and a solid or 8-ball has only a small 
white circle around its number. If we can find a way to 
reliably count the proportion of white pixels in the ball area 
and a corresponding expected range associated with each class 
the remaining task will only be one of distinguishing the 
8-ball from the other solid color balls.

The main challenges of this sub-task are:
- ensuring robustness to 
  illumination changes
- coping with specific ball color (some of them might 
  be of a brightness approaching white)
