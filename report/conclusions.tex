\section{Conclusions and Future Work}


The developed system has achieved satisfactory performance in table segmentatation and balls segmentation, localization and classification, 
especially considering that it is exploiting only traditional computer vision techniques without the use of Machine Learning or Deep Learning.
Additionaly, the generated 2D maps proved to represent accurately the game events on each frame, leading to the creation of a modified version
of the given videos in which useful and accurate informations are shown. 
\newline \\
A possibile way in which the project could be improved is the adaptation to live-streaming billiard games. In this case the program should be modified
in order to process the video frames in real-time. Additionaly, in order not to lose any frame, strict time constraints on the images processing must be added.
