% The report was written by the person owner of the task, apart from
% the into section written by Mattia Toffolon.

In this Section, how the workload was split between the authors is shown along with the amount of working hours spent by each one.

The following table associates each identified task with an author. Each author was responsibile for the creation and development of the owned tasks solution.
In some cases, minor contributions in terms of ideas were given by authors different than the task owner.

\begin{flushleft}
For what concerns the production of the project report, each author was responsibile for the writing of the sections relative to the owned tasks. \\   
\end{flushleft}
The writing of the remaing sections was split in the following manner.
Sections: Introduction, Project structure, Experimental setup, Workload split, Conclusions and Future work, were written by Mattia Toffolon. 
Section: Results, was written by Giovanni Artico. \\

\noindent
The amount of working hours spent on the project (code and report) by each author is represented in the following table.
