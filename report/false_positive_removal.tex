An issue we encountered was the removal of false positives in the
final output. these came in three flavours:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a flat region of the field, for example on the borders
    \item the holes 
    \item the player
\end{enumerate}

the first two kinds are easily detectable as we know the position of the holes 
and a flat region is easily detectable. However the player is not a easily detectable
shape and must be considered by itself.
The first consideration we can make is that the player and the holes reach out of the
fabric region. Given the precision of the table detection we can exploit this to find
such regions. One idea is to use Canny to find the edges of each object (tweaking 
the parameters so that the internal edges of the pool table) we can eliminate 
the connected edges that go outside this region. After this we can consider
