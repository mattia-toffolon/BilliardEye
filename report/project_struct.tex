\section{Project Structure}


The project has been developed using the CMake build system and it is organized with the
following structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|include| directory, contains the header source code files;
    \item \verb|src| directory, contains the implementation source code files;
    \item \verb|data| directory, contains the background image used to generate the 2D map;
    \item \verb|samples| directory, contains the system input, outputs and groud truths;
    \item \verb|CMakeLists.txt|, contains CMake instructions to organize the build of the project. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Furthermore, folders \verb|include| and \verb|src| are further divided into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|segment| directory, contains the files for table and balls segmentatation;
    \item \verb|recognition| directory, contains the files for balls classification and side recognition;
    \item \verb|tracking| directory, contains the files for balls tracking;
    \item \verb|rendering| directory, contains the files for the map rendering;
    \item \verb|utils| directory, contains additional files that implement various utilities.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Additionaly, \verb|src| folder contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|shared_main.cpp| file, implements the full video rendering and masks generation;
    \item \verb|performance_main.cpp|, implements the computation of all performance metrics across all videos.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
It must be noted that \verb|samples| folder is given in \verb|.zip| format for convenience.
In order to run \verb|performance_main.cpp| successfully, such file must be unzipped.
